"To determine the top 4 matches to bet on for the home team to win, we need to consider several factors, including the odds, team form, league position, expected goals, player injuries or suspensions, and travel distances. Based on the data provided and generic knowledge about the teams, here are the best bets:\n\n1. **Manchester City vs. Southampton**\n   - **Odds:** Low home odds (1.11), indicating a strong favorite.\n   - **Expected Goals:** High expected home goals (4.62) vs. away goals (0.81).\n   - **Form:** Manchester City has a strong form (WWDDW) against a low-performing Southampton (LLLDL).\n   - **Other Considerations:** Manchester City is a top contender in the Premier League, and Southampton has struggled against stronger teams. Despite the low odds, the likelihood of Manchester City's victory is very high.\n\n2. **Riga vs. Tukums**\n   - **Odds:** Moderate home odds (1.10), suggest Riga is a strong favorite.\n   - **Expected Goals:** Strong expected home goals (3.29) vs. minimal away goals (0.22).\n   - **Form and Points:** Riga is in excellent form (WWWWD) and holds a significant points advantage (78 vs. 32).\n   - **Other Considerations:** Riga is known for being one of the dominant teams in the Latvian Virsliga, and Tukums is not performing well.\n\n3. **PSV Eindhoven vs. PEC Zwolle**\n   - **Odds:** Very low home odds (1.08), suggesting high confidence in a PSV win.\n   - **Expected Goals:** Moderate expected home goals (1.94) with very low expected away goals (0.19).\n   - **Form:** PSV's unbeaten streak (WWWWW) suggests strong current performance, whereas PEC Zwolle\u2019s form is varied (LDWLD).\n   - **Other Considerations:** PSV is known for being a top team in the Eredivisie, and they rarely drop points at home against lower-tier teams. \n\n4. **Benfica vs. Rio Ave**\n   - **Odds:** Reasonably favored (1.18) for Benfica, indicating strong expectations.\n   - **Expected Goals:** High expected home goals (6.07) vs. negligible away goals (0.12).\n   - **Form:** Benfica in top form (WWWDW), Rio Ave\u2019s inconsistent form (DLDLW).\n   - **Other Considerations:** Benfica's status as a dominant team in Portugal makes them a solid choice. They are typically formidable at home.\n\n### Additional Considerations:\n- **Injuries/Suspensions:** None mentioned in the data, but known top teams are less likely to be affected enough to influence outcome drastically.\n- **Travel Distances:** The travel and away disadvantages aren't elaborated in detail, but home advantage plays a significant role for the home teams mentioned.\n- **Return on Investment:** These selections have varying levels of odds, with PSV Eindhoven and Manchester City having very low odds. However, the high certainty of their winning status compensates for the lower return, providing stability and likely success in the bet.\n\nBased on these factors, if you aim for certainty, matches like Manchester City, PSV Eindhoven, and Riga are top choices. For slightly better odds with still high win probability, Benfica stands out."
